# Filza26Maker

## Version 2.0 for Linux!
A small Bash program that takes the Filza File Explorer and converts it to an iOS 26 / iOS 18-ready IPA.
Updated to support Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) implementations as opposed to requiring MacOS.

# Installation for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

## Install WSL and Ubuntu (Powershell):
wsl --install -d Ubuntu

*I recommend an easy to remember password such as 1234! Remember that the password characters are invisible as you type them.*

## Required Tools (Ubuntu Terminal):
sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo apt install zip -y

## Navigate to Filza26Maker (Ubuntu Terminal):
cd /mnt/c/users/yourusername/desktop

bash Filza26Maker.sh

*(or wherever else you may have placed Filza26Maker.sh, the desktop is an example)*

# Congratulations, you have successfully compiled Filza for the latest iOS versions!!
